# ApeMatcher

ApeMatcher is a contract designed to match APE owners and Kennel owners and allow them to claim their tokens together in a trustless fashion. 

## Issue 

Currently you recieve 856 more tokens for claiming an APE + Kennel or a Mutant Ape + Kennel. There are owners sending each other NFTs worth hundreds 
of thousands of dollars to each other in order to be elligible for this extra token airdrop amount. 

## Solution

ApeMatcher is a contract that accepts Apes, Mutant Apes and Kennel Club NFTs and automatically matches these NFTs with each other. 

Once an Ape <> Kennel Match is formed, ApeMatcher then claims the tokens from the Ape Coin contract on behalf of the Ape and Kennel Owner. 

When the Ape Coin has been claimed, the Ape, Mutant or Kennel owner can claim their Ape and a percentage of the 856 extra tokens they will recieve. 

## Distribution

ApeMatcher: 20% (171.2 APE)
